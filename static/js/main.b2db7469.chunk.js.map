They had heard this and other darker rumours before, of course; but hobbits have a passion for family history, and they were ready to hear it again. Well, so they say, said the Gaffer. You see: Mr. Drogo, he married poor Miss Primula Brandybuck.She was our Mr. Bilbos first cousin on the mothers side (her mother being the youngest of the Old Tooks daughters);\",\n    \n    \"and Mr. Drogo was his second cousin. So Mr. Frodo is his first and second cousin, once removed either way, as the saying is, if you follow me.And Mr. Drogo was staying at Brandy Hall with his father-in-law, old Master Gorbadoc, as he often did after his marriage (him being partial to his vittles, and old Gorbadoc keeping a mighty generous table);\",\n    \n    \"and he went out boating on the Brandywine River; and he and his wife were drownded,and poor Mr. Frodo only a child and all.  Ive heard they went on the water after dinner in the moonlight, said Old Noakes; and it was Drogos weight as sunk the boat. And I heard she pushed him in, and he pulled her in after him, said Sandyman, the Hobbiton miller.\",\n    \n    \"You shouldnt listen to all you hear, Sandyman, said the Gaffer, who did not much like the miller. There isnt no call to go talking of pushing and pulling. Boats are quite tricky enough for those that sit still without looking further for the cause of trouble.Anyway: there was this Mr. Frodo left an orphan and stranded, as you might say,\",\n    \n    \"among those queer Bucklanders, being brought up anyhow in Brandy Hall. A regular warren, by all accounts. Old Master Gorbadoc never had fewer than a couple of hundred relations in the place.Mr. Bilbo never did a kinder deed than when he brought the lad back to live among decent folk. But I reckon it was a nasty shock for those Sackville-Bagginses.\",\n    \n    \"They thought they were going to get Bag End, that time when he went off and was thought to be dead.And then he comes back and orders them off; and he goes on living and living, and never looking a day older, bless him!

The Sackville-Bagginses wont never see the inside of Bag End now, or it is to be hoped not.\",\n    \n    \"Theres a tidy bit of money tucked away up there, I hear tell, said a stranger, a visitor on business from Michel Delving in the Westfarthing. All the top of your hill is full of tunnels packed with chests of gold and silver, and jools, by what Ive heard.Then youve heard more than I can speak to, answered the Gaffer. I know nothing about jools.\",\n    \n    \"Mr. Bilbo is free with his money, and there seems no lack of it; but I know of no tunnel-making. I saw Mr. Bilbo when he came back, a matter of sixty years ago, when I was a lad.Id not long come prentice to old Holman (him being my dads cousin), but he had me up at Bag End helping him to keep folks from trampling and trapessing all over the garden while the sale was on.\",\n    \n    \"And in the middle of it all Mr. Bilbo comes up the Hill with a pony and some mighty big bags and a couple of chests.

But my lad Sam will know more about that. Hes in and out of Bag End.\",\n    \n    \"Crazy about stories of the old days he is, and he listens to all Mr. Bilbos tales. Mr. Bilbo has learned him his letters - meaning no harm, mark you, and I hope no harm will come of it. Elves and Dragons I says to him. Cabbages and potatoes are better for me and you. Dont go getting mixed up in the business of your betters, or youll land in trouble too big for you,\",\n    \n    \"I says to him. And I might say it to others, he added with a look at the stranger and the miller. But the Gaffer did not convince his audience. The legend of Bilbos wealth was now too firmly fixed in the minds of the younger generation of hobbits. Ah, but he has likely enough been adding to what he brought at first, argued the miller, voicing common opinion.
