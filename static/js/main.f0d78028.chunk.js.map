They had heard this and other darker rumours before, of course; but hobbits have a passion for family history, and they were ready to hear it again. Well, so they say, said the Gaffer.

So Mr. Frodo is his first and second cousin, once removed either way, as the saying is, if you follow me.And Mr. Drogo was staying at Brandy Hall with his father-in-law, old Master Gorbadoc, as he often did after his marriage (him being partial to his vittles, and old Gorbadoc keeping a mighty generous table);\",\n    \n    \"and he went out boating on the Brandywine River; and he and his wife were drownded,and poor Mr. Frodo only a child and all.  Ive heard they went on the water after dinner in the moonlight, said Old Noakes; and it was Drogos weight as sunk the boat. And I heard she pushed him in, and he pulled her in after him, said Sandyman, the Hobbiton miller.\",\n    \n    \"You shouldnt listen to all you hear, Sandyman, said the Gaffer, who did not much like the miller. There isnt no call to go talking of pushing and pulling. Boats are quite tricky enough for those that sit still without looking further for the cause of trouble.Anyway: there was this Mr. Frodo left an orphan and stranded, as you might say,\",\n    \n    \"among those queer Bucklanders, being brought up anyhow in Brandy Hall. A regular warren, by all accounts. Old Master Gorbadoc never had fewer than a couple of hundred relations in the place.Mr. Bilbo never did a kinder deed than when he brought the lad back to live among decent folk. But I reckon it was a nasty shock for those Sackville-Bagginses.\",\n    \n    \"They thought they were going to get Bag End, that time when he went off and was thought to be dead.And then he comes back and orders them off; and he goes on living and living, and never looking a day older, bless him!

I know nothing about jools.\",\n    \n    \"Mr. Bilbo is free with his money, and there seems no lack of it; but I know of no tunnel-making.
